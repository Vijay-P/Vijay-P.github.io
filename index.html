      Hello,
      my name is Vijay Pillai. I am a college junior at Bard College at
      Simon's Rock and am majoring in computer science. If you are
      visiting this website, it most likely means that I have applied for a
      job or internship at your workplace. After you
      have read my resume, however, you will discover that my educational
      background is a rather odd one that will bring about several
      questions including: &quot;Why haven't you finished high school?&quot;
      and &quot;What and where is Bard College at Simon's Rock?&quot; It is,
      sadly, somewhat likely that these questions will cause potential
      employers to doubt in my abilities as an individual, student, and
      computer scientist. My goal in writing this page, however, is to
      dispel these notions.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Why I Did Not Finish High School</b><br/>
      Going through high school, I
      found several of my peers unmotivated, disinterested, or simply
      unfocused. This starkly contrasted with my personal motivation to
      find my passions and pursue my future as a productive member of
      society. This led me to look into non-traditional educational
      opportunities, which eventually led me to pursue a GED and &quot;drop
      out&quot; of high school after learning about my current institution,
      Bard College at Simon's Rock.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">
      <b>What
      is Bard College at Simon's Rock?</b><br>
      Bard College at Simon's
      Rock is America's only 4-year early college program, accepting
      students who have completed the 10th grade. Now, one
      might hear the words &quot;early college&quot; and immediately begin
      to doubt the quality of education that I am receiving. I urge you,
      however, to consider otherwise:</font></p>

      <ul>
      	<li/>
      <font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">95%
      	of the full-time faculty at Simon's Rock hold the highest degree in
      	their field.</font>
      	<li/>
      <font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Simon's
      	Rock has produced 9 Fulbright Fellows since 2010.</font>
      	<li/>
      <font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Simon's
      	Rock has a student faculty ratio of 8:1</font>
      	<li/>
    <font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Simon's
      	Rock received an academic rating of 99 from the Princeton Review - a
      	score that is equal to Yale, but higher than both Harvard and even
      	Princeton</font>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
      <font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Simon's
      Rock has been and is providing me with a one-of-a-kind education. While it
      does not exactly ring true with &quot;traditional,&quot; it is
      exceptional. I may be younger and possibly less experienced than your
      other applicants, but you will not find a more dedicated or motivated
      applicant for your workplace.</font>
