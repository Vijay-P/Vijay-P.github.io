        <br><br> &nbsp Everyone wants to have the next Uber or Instagram, and we've all spent the last couple of weeks sitting around and brainstorming about market spaces and product ideas. But the issue with making a good startup is that you need a
        focused and original minimum-viable product. We've all learned this. You need an idea that creates an advantageous wedge in the already existing market and system of technical solutions, and you need to focus on this wedge and capitalize off of
        it. Of course, anyone trying to come up with the next hot idea inevitably finds that innovation is hard. Everything eventually sounds like "Product X With a Twist," and none of these ideas hold water after you think about things like the hoops
        that your customers would have to jump through in order to get onboarded onto whatever complex service you are trying to market. The question becomes, how do we think of a wedge? How do we find that perfect niche market? <i>How do we think like innovators?</i>        The answer to this question is simple. If it's hard to think like an innovator, <i>then just don't</i>. Inveitably, all of us in technical fields end up with specific interests. There is something that always gets you excited, whether it be some
        IoT trend or some esoteric medical technology. What interests you is key. Let's say that you are interested in IoT. If you realize it, just start doing it. Devour every ounce of knowledge that you can. Practice your craft. Go out of your way to
        apply the things that you learn, even if it serves no immediate purpose. Try new things out. Thinking of IoT should become part of breathing. It should become natural. Successful entreprenurship is about being able to contextualize everything.
        It shouldn't be something that you struggle to do. It should be a altered state of awareness; a daily meditation. Everything that you do, from taking a shit to eating breakfast becomes about IoT. Then finally, you take all of these contextualizations
        and, subconsciously, you distill them into vision, focus. Before you know it, your consciousness changes. It's no longer just IoT, but IoT (or whatever your interest is) with a certain twist or added focus. Your become less near-sighted, and everything
        is seen in that adjusted context. And the chain continues. You think, learn, contextualize, distill, rinse, wash, repeat. When you find that you have gone through enough of these distillations, you will suddenly realize that you have arrived at
        something; an idea, a business, a profession: a real manifestation. It's a natural recipe for success. You take your idea and run. Easier said than done, right? The prospect is scary. The thing to remember is, even if you fail, you're still winning
        because you are progressing. Your idea isn't so important, because if you think like an innovator, you will become an innovator. Another idea will come. With each failure, your knowledge is expanding. You learn how not to fail, but also exactly
        how to fail. You begin to approach what thought is like for an innovator: breath.
