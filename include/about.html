                After you have read my resume, you will discover that my educational
                background is a rather odd one that will bring about several
                questions including: &quot;Why haven't you finished high school?&quot;
                and &quot;What and where is Bard College at Simon's Rock?&quot; I will use
                this space to discuss these matters.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Why I Did Not Finish High School</b><br/>
                Going through high school, I
                found several of my peers unmotivated, disinterested, or simply
                unfocused. This starkly contrasted with my personal motivation to
                find my passions and pursue my future as a productive member of
                society. This led me to look into non-traditional educational
                opportunities, which eventually led me to pursue a GED and &quot;drop
                out&quot; of high school after learning about my current institution,
                Bard College at Simon's Rock.</font></p>

                <b>What is Bard College at Simon's Rock?</b><br>
                Bard College at Simon's
                Rock is America's only 4-year early college program, accepting
                students who have completed the 10th grade. Here are some
                facts about Simon's Rock:</font></p>

            <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
                <font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Simon's
                Rock has been and is providing me with a one-of-a-kind education. While it
                does not exactly ring true with &quot;traditional,&quot; it is
                exceptional. I may be younger or possibly less experienced than your
                other applicants, but you will not find a more dedicated or motivated
                applicant for your workplace.</font>
